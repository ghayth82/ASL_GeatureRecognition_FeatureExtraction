This file contains descriptions for all the files and how to run them.

Please follow the specified order of running the files to avoid any errors.

RUNNING THE SCRIPT FOR TASK 1:-
->Task1_Scrip_V1.m ::
	When you run this file, a window will open where you can choose the CSE572_A2_data 	Folder.
	Once this folder is chosen. This files runs and creates a folder named 	'transformedDataFolder' inside the  CSE572_A2_data Folder. This is where it saves 	all the 10 csvs Each CSV is per gesture and in the format specified in the 		assignment 2 document.


**NOTE** 
After successfully running the 'Task1.scrip.V1.m' script, please open the init_globalVariables.m file and change the folderName variable to point to transformedDataFolder. 
Example:- folderName = '/Users/ishanshrivastava/Documents/Masters At ASU/Spring Sem 2017/Data Mining CSE 572/Project/Assignment 2/CSE572_A2_data/transformedDataFolder/';

RUNNING THE SCRIPT FOR TASK 2:-
->Task2_Script_V3.m ::
	->Run this file. It will generate 6 CSVs. 
	->5 CSVs for the 5 feature extraction methods that we have used, with each one 		containing the extracted features (by the particular method) for all the 10 		gestures.
	->6th CSV is the combined CSV, containing all the features extracted by all the 	five methods for all the 10 gestures.

RUNNING THE SCRIPT FOR TASK 2:-
->Task3_Script_V1.m ::
	->Run this file.It will read the combined feature matrix that was created and 		saved after running Task2_Script_V3.m. 
	->It will generate 2 CSVs and 12 plots.
	->The first CSV will be all the Eigen Vectors as columns and all the sensors as 	rows. The second CSV will the original feature matrix in the transformed space of 	given the Eigen vectors.
	->The first 2 plots generated will be the Eigen vectors against the original 		features. 1 plot with all the Eigen Vectors and the other with only top 10 Eigen 	Vectors.
	->The other 10 plots will be box plots for the 10 gestures similar to the ones 		created in Task 2. These will compare the top 10 principal components for a 		gesture and not of that gesture.


**OPTIONAL FILES TO RUN**
->The 2 files mentioned below were used to make various plots for our personal analysis. You can choose to run them to see the plots for yourself.

->plotCombined_GestureNotGesture_AllFeatureBoxPlot.m::
	->This file outputs 70 plots. Each plot is for a gesture and a particular feature 	extraction method, showing the all 23 features. It will have box plots comparing 	features(sensors) of a gesture with that of anything NOT of that gesture.

**OPTIONAL
->plotCombined_GestureNotGesture_GoodFeatureBoxPlot.m::
	->This file outputs 10 plots. Each plot is for a gesture, showing the good 		features we identified. It will have box plots comparing features of a gesture 		with that of anything NOT of that gesture.
